Repository
----------

The idea for this plugin is to make a repository for all the 
plugins (and software in general for the future) for slashcode. 
We must plan also to support themes but
they are more complicated to use now so for the moment, only plugins
are supported.

The fields that define a plugin entry are:

- slashcode user
- plugin name
- plugin description
- URL for the plugin
- plugin version
- plugin status: alfa, beta, release
- plugin category
- timestamp

The idea behind this plugin is to put it in http://slashcode.com/repository.pl
a plugin repository in order to push the plugin community.
