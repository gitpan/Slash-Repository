Welcome to the Repository Help system.
<p>
The method to insert a new entry in the system (plugin, theme ...)
is to insert a description for the entry and the first time,
also a description for the first release.
<p>
The data has to be approved by the service admin. Until a
description and a release for the entry has been approved, the
data will not be shown in 
<a href="[% constants.rootdir %]/repository.pl?op=list">the 
main entries list</a>.
<p>
If you change any data about a description or a release, this data
will be unapproved until the service admin check them.
<p>
When you want to a announce new releases of the entry you have
created in the past, you need only to create a new release 
following the link in the page that shows <a href="
[% constants.rootdir %]/repository.pl?op=mine">your plugins 
info</a> under each plugin info.
<p>
When an entry is shown it is also displayed the last release for
this entry. The entry will not be shown if it has not an approved 
release for it.
<p>
If you have any doubt about the system or you think you have
found a bug or you want new functionality not present, you 
can contact brian@tangent.org or acs@barrapunto.com.
<p>
Good luck!
